README.md
=========

This repo provides .srt subtitles (and possibly some captioning work) of videos I translated from English into French. It is meant mainly for double-check and additional portfolio in case needed. I only push here the subtitles of videos that have been made public.


For YouTube videos among them (most of them), I also made a playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ZHd0ljZE3Vvzl-0V5B6DhQ_FHP6GQwx).

### specific contributions


Here is the list of the presented contributions that involved other contributorsto some extent:

- "Octotales: MailChimp" had been partially translated (less than 40%) and what had been translated needed some important reviewing, although it wasn't bad.

- Same for "How to set up Atom 1.0 with your preferences", 40% done and to thoroghly review, especially for the technical terms.

- there was a text made by a non-native French speaker that was a very poor text and that I had to overwrite for the video about Schema.org markup use affecting ranking.
