README.md
=========

This repo provides .srt subtitles (and possibly some captioning work) of videos I translated from English into French. It is meant mainly for double-check and additional portfolio in case needed. I only push here the subtitles of videos that have been made public.


For YouTube videos among them (most of them), I also made a playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ZHd0ljZE3Vvzl-0V5B6DhQ_FHP6GQwx).
